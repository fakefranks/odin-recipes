        <h2>Easy salad</h2>
          <p>So, this is a quick and filling salad. You make prepare the chicken any way you'd like. I prefer to cut it up, season it,
            and stick it in the air fryer. For the potatoes, you can boil, bake, microwave, or air fry them. I use the same seasoning
            for everything, Cooking With My Doctor - Adobo. That's all the cooking you need
            to do. In fact, you could make a batch of this to eat for lunch for the next couple of days if you wish!
