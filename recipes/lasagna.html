        <h2>Amazing Lasagna</h2>
         
        <p>This is a pretty easy recipe. You just need something to 
            boil the lasagna pasta in, an oven(or big microwave),
            something to cook the ground beef in, and a lasagna pan,
            could also just be a big cookie tray, it doesn't matter.
            This is my, "I don't want to cook again today or tomorrow 
            recipe".
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Lasagna pasta(9 strips)</li>
            <li>Pasta sauce(I like Prego's mushroom sauce)</li>
            <li>Regual box of cream cheese</li>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Adobo</li>
            <li>Your choice of shredded cheese(I like Monterey and Colby jack)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Put ground beef in pot with a smidge of water and season and cook</li>
            <li>Boil pasta</li>
            <li>After pasta is done, set three strips on your pan side by side</li>
            <li>Add a thin layer of sauce</li>
            <li>Add layer of cooked meat</li>
            <li>Add small, cut rectangles of cream cheese</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3-6 again adding the pasta on top of this layer</li>
            <li>Add another layer of pasta with sauce on top, then add a handful of shredded cheese</li>
            <li>Pop in oven(or microwave) until cheese is melted then enjoy!</li>
