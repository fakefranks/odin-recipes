       <h2 class="sgheddy two">Quick and easy dinner</h2> 
         <p class="sgheddy para">For this recipe we need two separate pots. One for the meat and one for the pasta. I'm not one for
            measuring meat exactly so what I do is buy a pound of ground beef and separate it into three equal
            parts. I place each in a freezer bag and store them in the freezer until I want to use them. For This
            dish, I just take a bag out and thaw in the fridge overnight or for an hour or two in a bowl with cold water.
            As for the pasta, I just take out however much the box says is two servings so I can make enough for dinner and lunch
            the next day. My go to sauce is Preggo's mushroom sauce and I buy the smallest jar and use the whole thing.
